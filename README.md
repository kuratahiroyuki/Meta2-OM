# Execution
# 1 Setting directories
Users must keep the directory structure

# 2 Construction of dataset and ESPF
Before simulation, users build dataset files for cross validataion and independent test:
>sh data_prep.sh
  
# 3 Baseline model
Encoding: DNC TNC RCKmer ENAC binary CKSNAP NCP ANF EIIP PseEIIP PSTNPss 
Machine learning: RF SVM XGB LGBM
## 3-1 Training and testing of baseline models
$cd program/network
$sh main.sh
(ml_train_test_2OM.py) 

## 3-2 Prediction performance visualization
To see the prediction results, users must set the input parameters in analysis.py.
$cd program
$python analysis.py

# 4 Combination of selected baseline models
To make a combined model, users must set the input parameters in ml_fusion_D.py
$cd program/network
$ml_fusion_2OM.py
The final prediction results by the combined model is saved in /data/result/combine.csv
